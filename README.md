### The Problem It Solves

1. **Companies lose revenue on ad platforms due to people using adblock and faking impressions.**
**Solution** - 
Our solution incentivizes viewers to view ads by offering them Vendos (VEN, ERC20) for verifying their impressions.
Impressions are verified by asking viewers to fill out a captcha "related to the company's tagline", thus, making impressions really count.

2. **Privacy Issues in Centralized Ad Systems**
**Solution** - 
WE DON'T USE COOKIES! Personalization is still possible using wallet address but we let viewers opt out if they want.

3. **Validating Impression Count for CPI**
** Solution** -
Centralized Ad pricing works on trust, but decentralization makes this process more ** *transparent* ** and all impressions that are stored on the chain can be verified by the anyone including the publisher and marketer.
